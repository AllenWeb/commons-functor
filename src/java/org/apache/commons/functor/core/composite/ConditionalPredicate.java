/**
 * A {@link Predicate Predicate} 
 * similiar to Java's "ternary" 
 * or "conditional" operator (<code>? :</code>).
 * Given three {@link Predicate predicates}
 * <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>,
 * {@link #test tests}
 * to 
 * <code>p.test() ? q.test() : r.test()</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note that although this class implements 
 * {@link Serializable}, a given instance will
 * only be truly <code>Serializable</code> if all the
 * underlying functors are.  Attempts to serialize
 * an instance whose delegates are not all 
 * <code>Serializable</code> will result in an exception.
 * </p>
